# Project Name: CropAdvisor ML
# Description:  
CropAdvisor ML is a machine learning-based system that helps farmers choose the optimal crop to cultivate based on environmental factors. By taking user inputs such as nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, the system predicts the best crop suited for the given conditions. Utilizing powerful ensemble algorithms like XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, CropAdvisor ML delivers highly accurate recommendations, ensuring maximum yield and resource efficiency for farmers.
